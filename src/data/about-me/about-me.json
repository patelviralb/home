    "I'm Software Engineer learning to make things simple and better. Currently I'm Computer Science Graduate Student at Northeastern University, Boston.",

    "Before commencing my graduate degree, I was working as a Software Developer with nearly 7 years of work experience. Creating a high quality modular code which is easier to maintain and extend was one of my considerable accomplishments. I also like to continuously challenge myself to innovate and/or automate things which helps me and my team to create high quality software applications. Being a firm believer of life-long learning, I always try to learn through experimentation. As a result, I would often work on some personal projects which includes domains like Web Technologies and Cloud Computing. Apart from these, I am also interested in applied Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.",

    "During my time-off, you'll find me casually reading books, surfing articles on the internet or watching some cartoons, sci-fi series or movies and I like to call it my passive learning."
